# Sentiment Analysis from Social Media 

This project performs sentiment analysis on social media data using Python. The analysis is conducted in a Google Colab environment, utilizing a dataset that captures various sentiments expressed in social media posts. 


## Files Included 

- **Sentiment Analysis.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the code for the sentiment analysis. This notebook includes code snippets, explanations, and visualizations of the results.  
- **Sentiment Analysis.pdf**: A detailed report summarizing the methodology, findings, and conclusions drawn from the sentiment analysis.  
- **sentiment_dataset.csv**: The dataset used for analysis, containing social media posts and their corresponding sentiment labels.  

## Getting Started 

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine or access it directly in Google Colab.  
2. **Open the Notebook**: Launch the `Sentiment Analysis.ipynb` notebook in Google Colab.  
3. **Load the Dataset**: Ensure the `sentiment_dataset.csv` file is uploaded to the Colab environment.  
4. **Run the Code**: Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the sentiment analysis.
